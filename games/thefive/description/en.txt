After death due to an accident, the Kirill end up in purgatory - a place between heaven and hell, where everyone has a chance to atone for sins
committed during their lifetime. There are five dispensers in front of him, each of which symbolizes the sins he has committed:
Gluttony, Greed, Pride, Anger and Fornication.
He is given a choice: to atone for his sins by destroying them and going to heaven, or to stay with them and go to burn in hell.
Each of the sins appears before the main character in a physical shell, and he will have to fight them â€” thereby correcting himself.
